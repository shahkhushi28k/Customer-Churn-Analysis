Customer churn analysis is a process of analyzing customer behavior and identifying patterns or indicators that predict customer churn, which refers to when customers stop using a product or service. It involves collecting and analyzing relevant data, such as customer demographics, transaction history, and usage patterns, to develop predictive models that can forecast which customers are at a higher risk of churning. The insights gained from churn analysis help businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve customer retention strategies.
